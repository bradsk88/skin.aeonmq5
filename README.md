skin.aeonmq5
============

My personal mod of the MQ5 skin.  This adds a few things:<br/>
-Extra "Newest Episodes" submenu to the TV Shows widget which shows the newest episodes by <b>air date</b><br/>
-YouTube has been added as one of the default menus on the home screen.<br/>
--Soon: Youtube widget which shows newest videos from subscriptions in the same style as the TV Shows widget.<br/>
